                <h1 id="2024-Annual-Summary"><a href="#2024-Annual-Summary" class="headerlink" title="2024 Annual Summary"></a>2024 Annual Summary</h1><p>Today is 31st December, The last day of 2024, It’s necessary for me to write an article of 2024 annual summary.</p>
<h2 id="January"><a href="#January" class="headerlink" title="January"></a>January</h2><p>On the same month of 2023, I created a new project called iPhone-Bark, everything is starting from I wrote one script in Ubuntu which let me send Bark service that transfers messages from Laptop to iPhone. And then I wanted to make an GUI application with tkinter package for this demand. Then I did. With more and more designs, compile and test, at last is safeguard. On 1st January 2024, I pushed one commit to GitLab, which commit message is ‘fix up some bugs’</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/GitLab%20Repository.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="GitLab Repository"></p>
<p>And on 31st December 2023, I created a docker container, built an wiki.js website to collect some programming skills.</p>
<p>About next 10 days, I just developed iPhone-Bark project, One part of it is email verification when signing up account. 17th January, I posted a google blog of self introduction. Selenium spider of DouYin also running(selenium hub remote webdriver)python and Java version.</p>
<p>27th January, I went to Lu’an with my aunt and cousin. During waiting for my brother to leave school. Aunt said so many things to me, all in all is hope me to leave home, earn money, and I mentioned bitcoin.</p>
<h2 id="February"><a href="#February" class="headerlink" title="February"></a>February</h2><p>There has three days from I went to Lu’an, on the first day of February, I ordered a takeaway for my breakfast, this takeaway is ChangFen, Famous food in Guangdong.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Takeaway%20Bill.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Takeaway Bill.jpg"></p>
<p>3rd February, I can’t stand the craving for coffee. I bought some coffee relative tools and coffee beans with saved money from takeaway.</p>
<p>And 9th February is Chinese New Year eve, on 7th, I came back alone by Bus. The most thing I need to do is get my delivery. At that day evening, I made a cup of hand-brewed coffee.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Coffee.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Coffee"></p>
<p>Then was new year, nothing to say. I didn’t go to any relatives’ house to pay New Year’s greetings. Only thing I need to mention is on 16th, I came to HuoShan with uncle to have greeting. That time I was drunk. Vomit, so embarrassing.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/HuoShan.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="HuoShan"></p>
<p>19th February, I wrote an article in DayOne, In this article, I said I fell that I’m really sick these, and want to Lu’an, Hope change the environment. And JFrame development. In the next few days of February, My mood is bad , because uncle and aunt or other relative always said something to me. On 29th February, I really went to Lu’an, and the February was passed.</p>
<h2 id="March"><a href="#March" class="headerlink" title="March"></a>March</h2><p>After February 29th, I arrived in Lu’an and stayed there for another 5-6 days. On March 2nd, I ordered a takeout of LongJiang pork trotter rice and thought it was delicious.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Pig's%20Foot%20Rice.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Pig&#39;s Foot Rice.jpeg">For this reason, when I was in Zhangjiagang in August, I ordered pork trotter rice, but it was not as delicious as what I had in Lu’an. I don’t know if it was my first time eating and I was amazed, so I gave it a high rating.</p>
<p>In March, I have been obsessed with and researching coffee. For example, on the 3rd, I bought a heated cup. Two types of coffee beans (Yirgacheffe and Honduran Sherry) are not tasty because I don’t like sour coffee. On the 12th, I bought another serving of Mandheling coffee beans.</p>
<p>On the 16th, there was an image file error in the macOS virtual machine, so I had to revert back to the snapshot from October last year. The Objective C application I wrote in early February in Lu’an (WebView to open local HTML files and view game dynamics offline) was gone.</p>
<p>On the 19th, I followed my father to Lu’an again. During these few days in Lu’an, I was developing a Java version of iPhone Bar, writing several articles such as “Memories and Impressions”, “On March 22nd at 12:36 pm”, and ” Reading ‘Mischievous Pony Jump’ “. Then I went home on the 25th.</p>
<p>On the 31st, based on the Synology Cam application on the Windows platform, I would like to write a desktop application based on WebView, This leads to the use of JXbrowser</p>
<h2 id="April"><a href="#April" class="headerlink" title="April"></a>April</h2><p>On April 1st, I followed my father to my hometown in Bajiaotang. The water fir forest was lush and eye-catching.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Shuishan%20forest.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Shuishan forest.jpeg"></p>
<p>In early April, almost every night before going to bed, I would write a DayOne essay titled ‘Bedtime Notes’.</p>
<p>In mid April, my desire for remote access to NAS became even stronger, and I then researched the configuration of home broadband, enabling public IPv6, disabling firewalls, registering Alibaba Cloud domain names, DDNS, and completing the process step by step.</p>
<p>Before May, I set up the Typecho website and made modifications and developments to the Theme theme files.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Typecho%20Website.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Typecho Website"></p>
<h2 id="May"><a href="#May" class="headerlink" title="May"></a>May</h2><p>In May, I continued the development of the Typecho website by flexibly switching between multiple languages such as PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, creating a website interface with a unique feature that looks beautiful. I truly felt a strong sense of achievement.</p>
<p>On May 5th, I installed a virtual machine with the ChromeOS system, but it took me a while to delete it due to network firewall issues, insufficient storage space, and other reasons.</p>
<p>On May 12th, a network clipboard was created using MySQL database. Afterwards, I found a Cloud Clipboard project on GitHub that was very user-friendly. We are also continuing to research the public network IPv6 for home broadband.</p>
<p>I accidentally found an application called Delta on TikTok. After a detailed understanding, I learned that it was a simulator of game consoles such as NDS. I also found several game resources on the Internet. I was particularly fascinated by the siren of Zelda Land and Pokémon Diamond. This also laid the foundation for me to play Switch games in the future.</p>
<h2 id="June"><a href="#June" class="headerlink" title="June"></a>June</h2><p>On June 5th, I used the Switch on my computer to simulate and download the game “Zelda Kingdom Tears”.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/TearsOfTheKingdom.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="TearsOfTheKingdom"></p>
<p>I could play it normally, but the only problem was that I didn’t have a controller and couldn’t aim with a gyroscope. So on June 7th, I bought a Genesis Rooster NS controller, and spent the next month in Switch games. It took over 20 days to clear the Tears of the Fallen Nation, and around the 25th, I started playing P5R (Persona 5 Deluxe Edition) again. Due to storage space limitations, I bought another 64GB SD card.</p>
<h2 id="July"><a href="#July" class="headerlink" title="July"></a>July</h2><p>In July, I continued playing the Switch game “Tears of Zelda’s Kingdom”. I was still a bit unsatisfied with the game, so on the 10th, I started playing “Breath of the Wild” again.</p>
<h2 id="August"><a href="#August" class="headerlink" title="August"></a>August</h2><p>On July 31st, I went to Zhangjiagang with the aunt and Li congRong because they had been planning a trip for the past 10 days. I originally wanted my mom to go with me, but in the end, I went on a trip alone with them on the condition that she bought me the Kindle mentioned in 2022. We went to Guizhou for a trip, and I also got on a plane for the first time.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Airplane.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Airplane"></p>
<p>On the second night of the journey, my cousin Wang Xudong and I also stayed at an e-sports hotel for one night. Despite the exhaustion of the journey and the rare opportunity, I didn’t play any games. On August 5th, we returned to MaotanChang again. On the 13th, I went to Jiangsu with Li congRong again. He mainly wanted to see his brother Wang Xudong and get his newly bought computer. Then I will become a beauty and accompany him. On the 21st, I smelled a strong smell of smoke from Wang Dong’s dormitory, which ignited my desire to smoke. The next day, I bought a pack of Xiao Su cigarettes from the supermarket downstairs. Until now, smoke never leaves our hands. Returned from Zhangjiagang on the 23rd.</p>
<p>On August 29th, after a month of waiting, my mother finally gave me 460 yuan, and I also bought the Kindle Voyage that I had been deeply in love with before. August has just passed like this.</p>
<h2 id="September"><a href="#September" class="headerlink" title="September"></a>September</h2><p>In early September, I often went out for a walk to avoid smoking in my room, and the Ming and Qing old streets in the evening were quite charming.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/OldStreet.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Old Street"></p>
<p>On September 10th, I had no balance or cigarettes in my phone. What should I do? I asked my mother for 50 yuan and took a bus alone to Lu’an, where I bought two packs of cigarettes, Xuanhemen and Puwan. Smoking was discovered by my grandmother. On September 17, Mid-Autumn Festival, Grandma cooked a lot of dishes I like to eat, such as pickled Chinese cabbage, croaker, chicken fillet, etc. Unfortunately, I didn’t take a single photo. During my 10 days living in Lu’an, I read many Kindle e-books and modern urban romance novels such as “Rebirth 80, My Wife is a Bit Spicy”</p>
<p>On the 21st, I followed my mother back to MaotanChang, and on the 23rd, I picked up chestnuts with her. I will be reading ‘The Biography of Mao Zedong’ in the next few days.</p>
<h2 id="October"><a href="#October" class="headerlink" title="October"></a>October</h2><p>On October National Day, I had no plans to go anywhere. On the 2nd, Li congRong came to my house, and I went to our hometown with him and Niu Niu. We set up hammocks in the water fir forest, read books, and picked up chestnuts. Uncle invited us to Huoshan for dinner tonight (hotpot)<br><img src="https://media.yaonas.space/web_images/Wordpress/Countryside.jpeg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="Countryside"></p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 10th, I took a nap and had a dream. When I woke up, I recorded the content in classical Chinese on DayOne.</p>
<p>On the 18th, export DayOne content to a JSON file and import it into Typecho.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, a crawler project was developed to automatically obtain VPN subscriptions for xhjpro. However, on December 20th, it was discovered that the website had expired after adding email verification codes.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, I read several articles by Lin Huiyin, wrote a poem, and wrote it down with a brush. My mother may have seen this poem and bought me a brush worth over 30 yuan in early November.</p>
<h2 id="November"><a href="#November" class="headerlink" title="November"></a>November</h2><p>At the beginning of the month, I downloaded several books from Zlibrary and imported them into Kindle, such as “Passing by Your World” and “Sky City (My 26 Year Old Female Tenant)”. I have been reading ‘Sky City’ for a month, and as a novel, I can also be very fascinated by it.</p>
<p>On November 16, I went out to buy cigarettes and took a walk around the MaotanChang. I bought a bottle of water and two Shaobing . It seems that I have never bought Shaobing myself. Before (in junior high school), I followed my mother to buy vegetables and sell Shaobing to me.</p>

<p>On November 18, in order to finish the video I wanted to know the highest number of likes of my TikTok videos in the past two years, I started TikTok again. Unexpectedly, the URL encryption parameters changed again, from x-box to a-box. Fortunately, in the end, the reverse analysis completed the crawling. The result is a video of a corgi dog taking a T-step at the beginning of 23 years.</p>
<p>On November 28, my mother was not at home that day, and my father didn’t cook any food at night. I decided to buy instant noodles to eat. On the way, I thought that I planned to go to hell noodle restaurant to eat Little pan rice with LicongRong when he came back a few days ago. I decided to eat it alone. When I got to the ground, I found that hell noodle restaurant had disappeared and turned into a restaurant. So I had to go to the North Gate to eat Wonton. Before that, I went to the supermarket and bought two packs of cigarettes. LiQun·national beauty and heavenly fragrance and Marlboro Platinum 3.0. Marlboro charged me 30, which was really black. At night, when I got home, my dad found me smoking and we had a big argument. The next morning, I went out to buy breakfast. It was almost 6 o’clock and it was still dark. Walking on the road, smoking a mixed tobacco Marlboro was really comfortable. Before dawn at 6 o’clock that day, a platinum Marlboro on Youfang Street tasted the best</p>
<h2 id="December"><a href="#December" class="headerlink" title="December"></a>December</h2><p>On December 3rd, I exchanged cash for my phone balance to offset expenses, and then bought coffee filter paper, 20g Mandheling coffee beans for tasting, and 5 ShouMei tea pills.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 4th, I went to buy breakfast, took a walk, and went to the pavilion next to the cinnabar flushing warehouse to watch ‘My Tulip Miss’. A certain sentence made me think of her and secretly feel sad.</p>
<p>At the end of December, it was really terrible. On the 20th, email verification was added to the registration of xhjpro. The xhjpro spider I wrote was no longer useful. I had to modify it again, find a temporary email, register, and the program was not yet developed. On the 29th, I found that the website of the temporary email had added human-machine verification. On the 25th, I saw that the Jetbrains Space project would cease operations on June 1st, and spent the afternoon tinkering with Space On Premises. On the 27th, my father came back from Lu’an and bought a new phone, changing the home network from telecom to mobile. As a result, the websites I am currently building on my NAS cannot be accessed through a wide area network. The public IPv6 network can be pinged, but almost all ports are blocked. I have almost lost all motivation to develop NAS websites due to this network issue. I hope the network situation will return to its original state soon.</p>
